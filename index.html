                    Floods are one of the worst natural disasters, All emergency services from hospitals to flood-hit areas are closed! Roads are often submerged and power is cut off, leaving flood-prone areas isolated. It is very important to help the people in the flood
                    affected areas from outside! Because even if flood-prone areas have rich people, there is no way to help them! We are giving you the opportunity to help the flood affected people! You can help here according to your ability!
